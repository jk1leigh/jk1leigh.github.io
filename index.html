					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi! I'm a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. 
					My major is biological Sciences. I'm originally from Bluffton, SC.
					My family is from New Jersey but we moved when I was only 1.</p>
				<p><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
					I lived in Bluffton my whole life and decided to go to USC because my mom went
					 here and I've been coming to USC for games and events as long as I 
					 can remember and always loved the atmosphere it has. I love
					to watch tv and movies, read, hang out with my friends and family,
					and cook new things. </p>

					<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
					<p>After getting my science degree, I hope to pursue a career in becoming 
					a zookeeper. I'm hoping to get an internship soon and start there. I've always
					loved animals, I grew up with dogs and cats and always had friends that loved
					animals as much as I do. I want to focus my career on the caretaking of 
					elephants. I couldn't explain what makes them my favorite animal or what draws
					me to them but they've been my favorite since I can remember.</span></p>
